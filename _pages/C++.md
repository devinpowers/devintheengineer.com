I plan on posting notes here with some basic projects to show my understanding of concepts in C++

After Learning Python the past year, C++ syntax looks so funky, but after a few weeks, it's not too bad! so far..


## Week 1: C++ and Types

[Intro to C++ ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/intro_c++)

- Variables, Literals, and Constants
- Data Types (Int, Strings, Char)
- Basic Input and Output
- Type Conversion

## Week 2: Control Conditionals and References

[Operators to C++ ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/operators_c++)

- Operators (adding, dividing, etc)

[Control in C++ ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/control_c++)

- if statements, for loops, switch, and while loops 
- break and continue

[References in C++](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/c++_references)

* References vs Pointers

## Week 3: Functions

[Functions in C++ ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/functions_cpp)

- Intro to Functions
- Function Types and Overloading
- Function Return
- Recursion

## Week 4: Strings and Type Modifers
- Chars ('') and Strings ("")
- Type Modifers
  - const

## Week 5: Functions and Multiple File Compilation (working with Headers)

* Working with **Declerations** and **Definitions**

[Working with Multiple Files (Headers) in C++](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/c++_headers)



## Week 6: Vectors, Exceptions, and String Stream (importing txt files)

[Input and output ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/input_output)

- Opening Files (txt) and writing to files

[Working with txt files and Streams ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/c++_txt)

- Reading txt file, using getline() and ifstreams

- ostringstream and istringstream

[Vectors](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/c++_vectors)

 - Working with vectors
 - How to print vectors
 - 2-D vectors

[Handling Errors in C++](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/c++_handle_errors)

- try and catch 


## Week 7: Generic Algorithms and Iterators

[Basic Algorithms](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/c++_algorithms)

* Non-Modifying: find, find_if, search, accumulate

* Modifying: copy, transform

* Removing

* Mutating (elements) : sorting

* Lambdas


[Iterators in C++](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/c++_iterators)

- iterating using Strings and Vectors
- iterating using Maps and Sets


## Week 8: Associative Containers and Streams

[Maps](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/maps)

- Pairs, make_pair, 
- Maps
- Different way to insert into a Map

[Sets](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/sets)

- Set Union, Set intersection, and Symmetric Difference

[IO Streams ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/streams)

- Buffers
- istream and ostreams
- File Streams


## Week 9: Introduction to Classes

-  Introduction to Composition, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

[Classes](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/c++_classes)


## Week 10: More on Classes

- Constructors



## Extras:

[Arrays](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/arrays)

[STL Arrays](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/stl_arrays)

[Makefiles](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/makefiles)

[Pointers](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/pointers)

 - gotta work on!!
